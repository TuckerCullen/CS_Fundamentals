    "Heaps are a tree-based data structure that center around keeping either the smallest value (min heap) or largest value (max heap) at the top (root) of the heap. This rule must hold true for each subtree in the heap (the root must always be the largest (or smallest) value in any given subtree). Here we will talk about max heaps, where the root is the largest value, since a min heap is implemented the same just opposite. \n",
    "\n",
    "While max heaps have the largest value at the top, the rest of the values are only partially sorted. This means that unlike a binary search tree, you can't just traverse the tree to get the sorted order of the values. However, since the structure is less rigid then a BST, insertion takes a lot less time in practice (though asymptotically it insertion is still *O(log(n))*). However, the main differentiator between BSTs and Heaps is that in a heap, retrieving the largest value can be done in constant time O(1), since it is always located at the root. There are numerous applications where you might need quick access to the largest value, such as a prority queues. \n",
    "\n",
    "While heaps are generally represented visually in tree form, there is a faster way to implement them behind the scenes: using an array. the heap structure ensures that the tree is perfectly balanced and symmetrical. That means you can store the heaps values in an array while still being able to access a values children by doing a simple calculation. The values must be put in order in the array starting with the root in index 0, the left child in index 1, the right child in index 2, the leftmost child in the third level at index 3, etc. with this setup you can calulate the children of the node at index $i$ using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "left_child = $arr[(2*i) + 1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "right_child = $arr[(2*i) +2]$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also calulate the parent of the node at index i using:\n",
    "\n",
    "parent = $arr[(i-1)/2]$\n",
