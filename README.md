### A place for me to review computer science fundamentals 📝

I find that writing things things out at if I was explaining them to someone helps me learn. So here I've been compiling jupyter notebooks where I walk myself through various fundamental algorithms and data structures. All the code and writing is my own, but I sometimes include images taken from other websites for my own reference.
